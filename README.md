#  LeetCode DSA Roadmap by Sahil

Welcome! This repository is a structured and thoughtfully curated collection of LeetCode problems - organized topic-wise to help peers systematically master Data Structures and Algorithms.

Whether you're a beginner looking to build a strong foundation or someone brushing up for interviews, this roadmap aims to provide a clear, progressive path across all major DSA topics.

##  Why this Repo?

During my own learning journey, I often found scattered resources and inconsistent problem sets. So I decided to compile a clean, topic-wise roadmap with problems that build understanding step-by-step. Each solution in this repo is written with clarity and includes comments wherever helpful.

The goal:  
**To learn better, together and give back to the dev community.**
