LeetCode: 295. Find Median from Data Stream
Difficulty: Hard
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/

Approach:
----------
We maintain two heaps:
1. A **max-heap (small)** to store the smaller half of the numbers.
2. A **min-heap (large)** to store the larger half of the numbers.

Steps:
- We first push the number into the max-heap (invert sign since Python only has a min-heap).
- We then balance the heaps such that:
    - All elements in `small` are â‰¤ all elements in `large`.
    - The size difference between heaps is at most 1.
- Median is:
    - The root of the bigger heap if odd count.
    - The average of the roots of both heaps if even count.

Time Complexity:
- addNum(): O(log n)
- findMedian(): O(1)

Space Complexity: O(n)
